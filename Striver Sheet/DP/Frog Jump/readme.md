Sample Output 1:
20
0
Explanation Of Sample Input 1:
For the first test case,
The frog can jump from 1st stair to 2nd stair (|20-10| = 10 energy lost).
Then a jump from the 2nd stair to the last stair (|10-20| = 10 energy lost).
So, the total energy lost is 20 which is the minimum. 
Hence, the answer is 20.

For the second test case:
The frog can jump from 1st stair to 3rd stair (|10-10| = 0 energy lost).
So, the total energy lost is 0 which is the minimum. 
Hence, the answer is 0.
